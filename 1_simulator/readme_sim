This folder creates the simulator section by which the algorithm is tested. The simulator intializes multiple locations of different types (source, sensor, object) where source
and sensor may overlap and objects are always at positive altitude above nearby sensors, and then computes the distances source-object for each source-object-combination, and 
computes distances object-sensor for each sensor-object combination. For each sensor, it computes the sum of distances under all combinations and ejects those distances that are 
above a certain treshold ( if SNR<1 or distance>PDT ). These lists are ordered in ascending order and are returned as ( (x_s,y_s,z_s), ((t_1,f_1), ..., (t_N,f_N)), T) 
the location, the time delays measured and frequencies of these time delays, the time of sending of the message (in case of non-uniform clock for sources and sensors).

The intialization:
At least one source, at least four sensors within range of at least one common source, at least one object 
within range of at least four sensors and one common source. Sources are assigned unique frequencies.

The spectral simulation:

The return of a dataset:
The produced file is parsed to the algorithm folder.
